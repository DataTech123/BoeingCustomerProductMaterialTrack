A brief description of the above Boeing customer product material ERD diagram, which establishes relationships between entities (tables), primary keys, and foreign keys is fundamental for a purpose of SQL query data flow by using Microsoft Visio.
For various diagram designs, I can coordinate with the engineering project team for changes.

    **************The following SQL customer product material database structure matches the content of the ERD Diagram****************** 
The main purpose of the customer product material track database is to fetch data starting from the customer's service order (base table) to track each airline customer's airplane, which includes a total of price, product, material, order date, and stock quantity from a certain year in the customer account transaction system. This data model design in this project is just one example, according to my perspective and previous job experience at Boeing. 

In cases, where coordination with a database management or engineering team is required if needed, I can follow up to write various syntaxes (programming languages) for SQL queries.

Thank you for yourt review and questions for further developmen. In the next project, I use machine learning (Python script) to interact with the existing database in SQL.
